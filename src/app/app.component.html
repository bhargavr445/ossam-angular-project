<div class="myTest">
    Whenever we do some modification to existing .js, .css files, and move them to production environment those changes may not get reflected on the browser of customer who is using our software. This is because those .css and .js files have been cached in the browser. When the user accesses the URL, it will take the cached .js and .css files . That is the reason , those new changes will not be appeared to the user. Either he has to clear the browser cookie and reload the page or else he has to do hard refresh of the page by pressing ctl+f5

    But we can not ask each and every user to clear the cookie of their browser .Even we can not ask them to go for hard refresh of the page. So we can hack this through some approach. This is called Cache busting
